# **Grant Proposal for Wallet Pass - WebAuthn 2FA for Ethereum dApps**

## **1. Project Overview**

**Project Name:** WalletPass - Secure dApp Access with WebAuthn 2FA

**Objective:**  
To enhance the security of web3 decentralized applications (dApps) by integrating WebAuthn as a second factor of authentication (2FA), alongside traditional Ethereum wallet authentication. This solution aims to provide an additional layer of security, reduce the risks associated with wallet-based authentication, and improve user trust in dApps by offering phishing resistance and unauthorized access prevention.

## **2. Problem Statement**

Web3 dApps primarily rely on Ethereum wallets (like MetaMask) for user authentication. While wallet-based authentication provides a decentralized and user-controlled approach, it also introduces several security risks:

- **Compromised Wallets:** If a user's private key is compromised, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to all dApps associated with that wallet.
- **Phishing Attacks:** Users can be tricked into revealing their private keys or signing malicious transactions.
- **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Unlike traditional applications, most dApps do not offer additional layers of authentication to enhance security.

These issues create a barrier to mass adoption, particularly for users who prioritize security and are concerned about the vulnerabilities associated with wallet-based authentication.

## **3. Proposed Solution**

**WebAuthn 2FA Integration for dApps:**

WebAuthn (Web Authentication) is a modern web standard that provides strong, phishing-resistant two-factor authentication using public-key cryptography. By integrating WebAuthn as a second layer of authentication for dApps, we can significantly enhance security.

**How it Works:**

1. **User Authentication Process:**
   - The user logs in to the dApp using their Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask or WalletConnect).
   - Upon successful wallet authentication, the user is prompted to authenticate using WebAuthn as a second factor.
   - The WebAuthn flow involves either biometric authentication (like fingerprint or facial recognition) or hardware-based security keys (like YubiKey).

2. **Security Benefits:**
   - Even if an Ethereum wallet is compromised, unauthorized access to the dApp is prevented by requiring WebAuthn 2FA.
   - WebAuthn provides phishing resistance, making it extremely difficult for attackers to replicate the authentication process.
   - Multi-device support allows users to register multiple WebAuthn devices, ensuring seamless access from different devices.

## **4. Technical Implementation**

**Frontend:**

- The frontend will be built using **React.js** to provide a user-friendly interface.
- **Ethers.js v6** will be used for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- The **@simplewebauthn/browser** library will handle WebAuthn operations, including registration and authentication processes.

**Backend:**

- The backend will be developed using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
- **@simplewebauthn/server** will manage server-side WebAuthn operations, such as generating and verifying registration and authentication options.
- An in-memory user store (to be replaced with a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL in production) will keep track of registered devices and user authentication states.
- Communication between the frontend and backend will be secured using HTTPS.

**Deployment:**

- The solution will be deployed on a secure cloud infrastructure (such as AWS or Azure) with appropriate scaling and load balancing capabilities.
- Backend services will be containerized using Docker to ensure consistency and ease of deployment.
